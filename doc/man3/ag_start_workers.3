.SH NAME
ag_start_workers \- Start the worker threads for libag
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libag.h>
.sp
.BI "int ag_start_workers(void);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ag_start_workers ()
start the worker threads for libag.

The
.BR ag_start_workers()
and
.BR ag_stop_workers()
routines are designed  for experienced users who want to have refined control
over their worker threads: whether they should start or stop. By default, all
threads start with
.BR ag_init ()
and stop with
.BR ag_finish ().

If the
.I workers_behavior
attribute is set to
.IR LIBAG_MANUAL_WORKERS ,
in
.BR ag_init_config (),
worker threads will not be started automatically in init, but later through
this routine.

If
.I workers_behavior
is set to
.IR LIBAG_ONSEARCH_WORKERS ,
the launch and finish of the worker threads will be controlled by
.BR ag_search ().
This reduces the use of resources at the cost of more search time. It can be
useful if the user does not need to search as often.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise.
